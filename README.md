# liase_and_direct
An application that allow insite company communication and projects managment. -- nothing from this plans is ready.
The lack of expirience took revenge on me right now.
I forgot some basics, becouse I was not using JAVA, due to lack of time with my curent job. Last time I was coding a game in C# on Unity engine not a long ago,
few weeks before this project.
I never used React before. SDA Final Project I made with spring boot and thymeleaf templating. When I try to learn something it leads to more and more errors.
Like Switch what was used in prevous versions of React. Now it is Routes. Fuguring out that they just rename it cost me a lot of time (looking for posts, forums,
stack oveflow, youtube videos and documentaqtions). Same learn how to show page using javascript. I needed just put return (html code); into render() {}.
Easy might look, but I waste a lot of time on this. And that was almoust whole production workflow. Learn something -> it does't work -> try to find solution ->
it doesn't work too -> findout that it was easy to repair think and if you have expirience, there will be no problem.
If you find one uncultural word that I forgot delete and commited, I'm sorry. I have my lesson to NEVER put bad language into code, even when I'm very angry.
Propably this 'project' will be not accepted, but I agreed with this at this point. I'll return to study at the univesity, coding Unity games and doing my non IT work.
Have a nice day you all ;)
